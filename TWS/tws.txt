header commands:

level n ABCD:   n is level number, ABCD is a 4-character password
starttime n:    n is start time in seconds
lynx:           specify lynx ruleset
ms:             specify ms ruleset (not tested, probably doesn't work)
stepping x:     x can be one of the following:
                0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 even +1 +2 +3 odd odd+1 odd+2 odd+3
seed n:         specify random number seed, n is an unsigned 32-bit integer
force x:        specify initial random force floor direction, x can be one
                of the following:
                north west south east
route:          start of route, from here only route commands are accepted

route commands:

U D L R:        directions, generates a keypress in the indicated direction that
                lasts for 4 ticks
,:              do nothing for 4 ticks
u d l r:        generate a keypress in the indicated direction that lasts 1 tick
.:              do nothing for 1 tick
{UR} {UL} {DR} {DL}: move in two directions at once (block slapping)
!:              end of route, causes the rest of the file to be ignored.
                this is not required, reaching the end of the file has the same
                effect

all of the above can be prefixed with an integer n, which means the following
move should be repeated n times, like:
5U: move 5 up
13.: wait for 13 ticks
2{DL}: move down+left twice

misc commands:
